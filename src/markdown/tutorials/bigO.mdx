# Big O Complexity

Big O (O()) describes the upper bound of the complexity.
Little O (o()) describes the upper bound excluding the exact bound.
Theta (Θ()) describes the exact bound (or overlap between upper and lower bounds) of the complexity.
Omega (Ω()) describes the lower bound of the complexity.

## O(1)
Big O of 1 or 'constant time' does not increase with the size of the data set. 
#### Time
No matter how big a set, the time to run should be roughly the same.
#### Space
The function will add a fixed amount to the memory requirements when running.
#### Example - Access
```
function getElementAtIndex(array, index) {
    return array[index];
}

const myArray = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const element = getElementAtIndex(myArray, 2);

```
## O(log n)

Divide and conquer algorithms that split the work in two recursively will have this complexity.

#### Time
As the size of a set increases the time requirements increase logarithmically (sub-linearly) meaning the performance relative to a linear algorithm improves as the data set grows.
#### Space
Will need logarithmically increasing space as the data set grows.
#### Example - Binary Search
```
function binarySearch(array, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = array.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (array[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (array[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
